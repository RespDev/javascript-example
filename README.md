I do realise this could be made better by not hard coding channel ID's, using MySql or Mongo, and connecting to RabbitMQ for certain features.

ANY TOKENS IN THE CODE DO NOT WORK

I could put the tokens and such in a config and the channel ID's pretty easily.

By the way this project connects to MySql to store data that is accessible from roblox thru a WEB SOCKET API.

Uses https://marcsync.dev/ to communicate with a Roblox script.
